<h2>Payment systems are now available everywhere and everyone interacts with these systems every day.</h2>
There are different types of transactions you can make, SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID.<br>
• SALE: means to buy something and its price will be deducted from your bank account.<br>
• REFUND: this means that you will return something and wants your money back to your bank account.<br>
• Pre-Authorization: means holding an amount of money from your account, e.g Hotel reservation.<br>
• VOID: this means canceling the transaction, e.g if the seller entered the wrong amount.<br>
